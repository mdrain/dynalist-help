#### Is my data safe?

Short answer: it's pretty safe.

Long answer: We use the standard best practices for cloud services, including requiring HTTPS connections to our servers for security (the same thing banks use), firewalls protecting our database servers, and backups for user data.

Files uploaded to Dynalist are hosted at Amazon Web Services (AWS) and enjoys the security provided by it. To learn more, you can read about [AWS security policies](https://aws.amazon.com/security/).

#### Can I do anything to make my data safer?

Yes! Don't use simple passwords like `123456` and don't reuse passwords. Password managers like 1Password are your friend. Also remember to log out on public computers.

This is especially important if you keep high value information in your Dynalist. Before we have two-factor authentication, the weakest link is often at your end.
