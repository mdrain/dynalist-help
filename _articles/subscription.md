To get premium features and remove limitations, you upgrade to Dynalist Pro.

#### Pricing

Right now, Dynalist Pro costs $3.99 per month for annual subscriptions and $4.99 for monthly subscriptions. This is the price with the early bird discount, and we plan to remove the discount after we release mobile apps.

#### How do I upgrade?

You can upgrade [here](https://dynalist.io/pricing). Please log in to your Dynalist account in order to upgrade.

#### What do I get by upgrading?

Please refer to [Dynalist Pro features](../pro-features).

#### Can I get a free trial of Dynalist Pro?

If you import your data from WorkFlowy, you can get 14 days of free trial. Soon we will offer free trial to non-WorkFlowy users as well.

#### How do I pay?

We accept any major credit card such as Visa, MasterCard, and American Express. Unfortunately we don't support PayPal payments right now.

#### Is my credit card information safe?

We don't handle your credit card information directly. We use Stripe for accepting payment, which is trusted by thousands of companies like Twitter, Pinterest, and Shopify.

#### Can I get a group discount?

If you're upgrading more than 10 accounts, please [get in touch]({{ site.feedback_url }}) and we can talk about it.

#### Are there other discounts available?

By inviting your friends to use Dynalist, you can get Dynalist credit and use it for up to 50% of the subscription price. Learn more about our referral progoram [here](../referral).
